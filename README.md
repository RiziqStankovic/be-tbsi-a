# CI/CD on Kubernetes with GitHub, Digital Ocean, and Cloudflare - Project Documentation

This documentation outlines the architecture and workflow for a robust CI/CD setup using GitHub, Digital Ocean, and Cloudflare for a Kubernetes-hosted application.

## Hosting Platform Selection

I have chosen Digital Ocean with Kubernetes as my hosting platform. This decision is rooted in its scalability and robust management capabilities, making it an ideal choice for my application.

## Backend Application Development

my backend applications are built using Node.js. The source code is hosted on GitHub, ensuring version control and collaboration. I have rigorously tested these applications locally using Docker to ensure their functionality and reliability.

## CI/CD Workflow with GitHub Actions

To streamline the deployment process, I have implemented a comprehensive CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions. This workflow comprises the following key steps:

1. **Building the Application:** I automatically build the application from the source code.
2. **Running Tests:** Comprehensive testing ensures that the application functions correctly.
3. **Building Docker Containers:** I containerize the applications using Docker, ensuring consistency across environments.
4. **Pushing to Docker Hub:** The Docker containers are pushed to Docker Hub for easy accessibility.

## Digital Ocean Integration

Secure and authorized deployments to Digital Ocean are facilitated through the configuration of the necessary credentials, ensuring a seamless integration between GitHub and Digital Ocean.

## Kubernetes Deployment Using Helm

I simplify the deployment process on Kubernetes by employing Helm charts. Helm enables us to manage deployment configurations and dependencies efficiently, promoting maintainability and scalability.

## Ingress and Certificate Management

In the Digital Ocean Kubernetes cluster, I have established Ingress controllers to manage external traffic routing to the backend services. The automatic acquisition of SSL certificates is ensured through Cert Manager, guaranteeing secure communication.

## Content Delivery Network (CDN) with Cloudflare

Enhancing both performance and security, I have integrated Cloudflare as a Content Delivery Network (CDN). This addition accelerates content delivery by caching static assets and provides advanced security features. DNS records are configured to point to the Ingress controller, ensuring a seamless integration with Cloudflare.

## Project Structure

my project structure is organized to facilitate clear and efficient development and maintenance. Here's an overview:

```
- TBSI-DEMO-TEST-A/
  - .github/workflows/
    - cicd-tbsi-demotest.yml
    - test.yml
  - tbsi-demo-test-a-chart/
    - templates/
      - Chart.yml
      - values.yml
  - test/
    - test_be-a.js/
  - .gitignore
  - backend-a.js
  - docker-compose.yml
  - Dockerfile-a
  - package-lock.json
  - package.json
  - Readme.md
```

This structured layout ensures easy navigation and management of components within the project.

In conclusion, my CI/CD setup leverages the power of GitHub, Digital Ocean, and Cloudflare to create a seamless development and deployment pipeline. This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of my project, emphasizing key decisions and technologies used for a successful implementation.
